abstract = {To build systems shielding users from fraudulent (or phishing) websites, designers need to know which attack strategies work and why. This paper provides the first empirical evidence about which malicious strategies are successful at deceiving general users. We first analyzed a large set of captured phishing attacks and developed a set of hypotheses about why these strategies might work. We then assessed these hypotheses with a usability study in which 22 participants were shown 20 web sites and asked to determine which ones were fraudulent. We found that 23\% of the participants did not look at browser-based cues such as the address bar, status bar and the security indicators, leading to incorrect choices 40\% of the time. We also found that some visual deception attacks can fool even the most sophisticated users. These results illustrate that standard security indicators are not effective for a substantial fraction of users, and suggest that alternative approaches are needed.},

ABSTRACT = {Phishing attacks, which have existed for several decades and continue to be a major problem today, constitute a severe threat in the cyber world. Attackers are adopting multiple new and creative methods through which to conduct phishing attacks, which are growing rapidly. Therefore, there is a need to conduct a comprehensive review of past and current phishing approaches. In this paper, a review of the approaches used during phishing attacks is presented. This paper comprises a literature review, followed by a comprehensive examination of the characteristics of the existing classic, modern, and cutting-edge phishing attack techniques. The aims of this paper are to build awareness of phishing techniques, educate individuals about these attacks, and encourage the use of phishing prevention techniques, in addition to encouraging discourse among the professional community about this topic.},

As Internet usage is increasing day by day so are the cyber-crimes and scams. Phishing is one of the latest sophisticated techniques used by the scammers. Phishing website detection can help the users to avoid falling victim to these attacks. Although phishing websites are disguised as a legitimate one, fortunately they have some identifiable features. We have proposed a supervised learning approach using deep learning algorithms to detect phishing websites. We have achieved 94.8\% accuracy using standard neural network model and achieved 93.6\% accuracy with CNN (Conv2D) model. We have used a dataset downloaded from University of California, Irvine machine learning repository.},

abstract={The popularity of social networking sites has attracted billions of users to engage and share their information on these networks. The vast amount of circulating data and information expose these networks to several security risks. Social engineering is one of the most common types of threat that may face social network users. Training and increasing users' awareness of such threats is essential for maintaining continuous and safe use of social networking services. Identifying the most vulnerable users in order to target them for these training programs is desirable for increasing the effectiveness of such programs. Few studies have investigated the effect of individuals' characteristics on predicting their vulnerability to social engineering in the context of social networks. To address this gap, the present study developed a novel model to predict user vulnerability based on several perspectives of user characteristics. The proposed model includes interactions between different social network-oriented factors such as level of involvement in the network, motivation to use the network, and competence in dealing with threats on the network. The results of this research indicate that most of the considered user characteristics are factors that influence user vulnerability either directly or indirectly. Furthermore, the present study provides evidence that individuals' characteristics can identify vulnerable users so that these risks can be considered when designing training and awareness programs.},

This study reports a pilot survey of 232 computer users to reveal predictors of falling for phishing emails, as well as trusting legitimate emails. Previous work suggests that people may be vulnerable to phishing schemes because their awareness of the risks is not linked to perceived vulnerability or to useful strategies in identifying phishing emails. In this survey, we explore what factors are associated with falling for phishing attacks in a role-play exercise. Our data suggest that deeper understanding of the web environment, such as being able to correctly interpret URLs and understanding what a lock signifies, is associated with less vulnerability to phishing attacks. Perceived severity of the consequences does not predict behavior. These results suggest that educational efforts should aim to increase users' intuitive understanding, rather than merely warning them about risks.},

Automated phishing detection enables email clients to warn users that an email is suspicious, but current warnings are often not specific. We evaluated the effects on phishing susceptibility of (1) moving phishing warnings close to the suspicious link in the email, (2) displaying the warning on hover interactions with the link, and (3) forcing attention to the warning by deactivating the original link, forcing users to click the URL in the warning. We assessed the effectiveness of such link-focused phishing warning designs in a between-subjects online experiment (n=701). We found that link-focused phishing warnings reduced phishing click-through rates compared to email banner warnings; forced attention warnings were most effective. We discuss the implications of our findings for phishing warning design.},

abstract={Social engineering has posed a serious threat to cyberspace security. To protect against social engineering attacks, a fundamental work is to know what constitutes social engineering. This paper first develops a domain ontology of social engineering in cybersecurity and conducts ontology evaluation by its knowledge graph application. The domain ontology defines 11 concepts of core entities that significantly constitute or affect social engineering domain, together with 22 kinds of relations describing how these entities related to each other. It provides a formal and explicit knowledge schema to understand, analyze, reuse and share domain knowledge of social engineering. Furthermore, this paper builds a knowledge graph based on 15 social engineering attack incidents and scenarios. 7 knowledge graph application examples (in 6 analysis patterns) demonstrate that the ontology together with knowledge graph is useful to 1) understand and analyze social engineering attack scenario and incident, 2) find the top ranked social engineering threat elements (e.g. the most exploited human vulnerabilities and most used attack mediums), 3) find potential social engineering threats to victims, 4) find potential targets for social engineering attackers, 5) find potential attack paths from specific attacker to specific target, and 6) analyze the same origin attacks.},

ABSTRACT={With the significant growth of internet usage, people increasingly share their personal information online. As a result, an enormous amount of personal information and financial transactions become vulnerable to cybercriminals. Phishing is an example of a highly effective form of cybercrime that enables criminals to deceive users and steal important data. Since the first reported phishing attack in 1990, it has been evolved into a more sophisticated attack vector. At present, phishing is considered one of the most frequent examples of fraud activity on the Internet. Phishing attacks can lead to severe losses for their victims including sensitive information, identity theft, companies, and government secrets. This article aims to evaluate these attacks by identifying the current state of phishing and reviewing existing phishing techniques. Studies have classified phishing attacks according to fundamental phishing mechanisms and countermeasures discarding the importance of the end-to-end lifecycle of phishing. This article proposes a new detailed anatomy of phishing which involves attack phases, attacker’s types, vulnerabilities, threats, targets, attack mediums, and attacking techniques. Moreover, the proposed anatomy will help readers understand the process lifecycle of a phishing attack which in turn will increase the awareness of these phishing attacks and the techniques being used; also, it helps in developing a holistic anti-phishing system. Furthermore, some precautionary countermeasures are investigated, and new strategies are suggested.}

ABSTRACT = {Phishing attacks are a growing concern for individuals and organizations alike, with the potential to cause significant financial and reputational damage. Traditional methods for detecting phishing attacks, such as blacklists and signature-based techniques, have limitations that have led to developing more advanced techniques. In recent years, machine learning and deep learning techniques have gained attention for their potential to improve the accuracy of phishing detection. Deep learning algorithms, such as CNNs and LSTMs, are designed to learn from patterns and identify anomalies in data, making them more effective in detecting sophisticated phishing attempts. To develop a comprehensive understanding of the current state of research on the use of deep learning techniques for phishing detection, a systematic literature review is necessary. This review aims to identify the various deep learning techniques used for phishing detection, their effectiveness, and areas for future research. By synthesizing the findings of relevant studies, this review identifies the strengths and limitations of different approaches and provides insights into the challenges that need to be addressed to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of phishing detection. This review aims to contribute to developing a coherent and evidence-based understanding of the use of deep learning techniques for phishing detection. The review identifies gaps in the literature and informs the development of future research questions and areas of focus. With the increasing sophistication of phishing attacks, applying deep learning in this area is a critical and rapidly evolving field. This systematic literature review aims to provide insights into the current state of research and identify areas for future research to advance the field of phishing detection using deep learning.},

abstract={Email is of critical importance as a communication channel for both business and personal matters. Unfortunately, it is also often exploited for phishing attacks. To defend against such threats, many organizations have begun to provide anti-phishing training programs to their employees. A central question in the development of such programs is how they can be designed sustainably and effectively to minimize the vulnerability of employees to phishing attacks. In this paper, we survey and categorize works that consider different elements of such programs via a clearly laid-out methodology, and identify key findings in the technical literature. Overall, we find that researchers agree on the answers to many relevant questions regarding the utility and effectiveness of anti-phishing training. However, we identified influencing factors, such as the impact of age on the success of anti-phishing training programs, for which mixed findings are available. Finally, based on our comprehensive analysis, we describe how a well-founded anti-phishing training program should be designed and parameterized with a set of proposed research directions.},

abstract = {With ever-increasing amounts of data collected from citizens and businesses in Smart City environments, public administration agencies manifest their position as central data holders. However, this great ownership of data makes them a target of cybercriminals on the hunt for illicit enrichment. The predominantly used type of cybercrime is phishing and increasingly spear phishing, a more personal, target-oriented kind of phishing. Such attacks make use of so-called persuasion techniques to lure their victims. In this study, four persuasion techniques, namely Authority, Urgency, Danger and Benefit, were tested for effectiveness in a two-phased field experiment cooperating with four German municipalities. In total, 3452 fake phishing e-mails were sent to 1276 public officials. Results show that the persuasion technique of Authority has worked best and therefore presumably poses the biggest threat to the information integrity of public sector agencies, followed by Urgency, Benefit and Danger. Additionally, the study provides insight on the potential impact of the effects of constant exposure to phishing and shows that the degree of domain-specificity of attacks impacts the susceptibility of victims.},

abstract = {Phishing scam emails are emails that pretend to be something they are not in order to get the recipient of the email to undertake some action they normally would not. While technical protections against phishing reduce the number of phishing emails received, they are not perfect and phishing remains one of the largest sources of security risk in technology and communication systems. To better understand the cognitive process that end users can use to identify phishing messages, I interviewed 21 IT experts about instances where they successfully identified emails as phishing in their own inboxes. IT experts naturally follow a three-stage process for identifying phishing emails. In the first stage, the email recipient tries to make sense of the email, and understand how it relates to other things in their life. As they do this, they notice discrepancies: little things that are "off'' about the email. As the recipient notices more discrepancies, they feel a need for an alternative explanation for the email. At some point, some feature of the email --- usually, the presence of a link requesting an action --- triggers them to recognize that phishing is a possible alternative explanation. At this point, they become suspicious (stage two) and investigate the email by looking for technical details that can conclusively identify the email as phishing. Once they find such information, then they move to stage three and deal with the email by deleting it or reporting it. I discuss ways this process can fail, and implications for improving training of end users about phishing.},

abstract = {Phishing represents one of the most spread and effective cyber-attacks of our times. Warning messages are commonly employed in email clients to notify users about the possible danger and let them decide on their own. However, the high success rate of phishing attacks shows that the existing warnings are not yet adequate. This study contributes by proposing two novel warning dialogs for email clients that prevent users from immediately accessing the content of phishing emails. Specifically, the first one alerts the users against the potential scam, and the second one also reports explanations about the possible causes of the scam. A comparative between-subjects experiment with 300 participants has been performed. Results show that the proposed warnings better defend users from phishing emails than the warnings at the state-of-the-art. In addition, explanations resulted useful in preventing users from discarding genuine emails where warnings are displayed incorrectly due to misclassification of the email.},

abstract = {Remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to be the new normal, suggesting a situation where people use their personal computers at home for several activities like reading emails, surfing the web, chatting with friends. While doing this, users are not focused on securing their systems and they often do not have the skills and knowledge to defend against cybercrime. In this paper, we present the design and the evaluation of a novel interface that warns users against phishing attacks. This interface looks like the ones shown by browsers like Chrome and Firefox when opening a suspicious phishing website, but it includes information that explains the reasons why the website might be a scam. Such explanations are based on website features commonly used by AI-based systems to classify a website as phishing or not and aim to help users detecting phishing websites. To ensure a high understandability and effectiveness of the explanations, the C-HIP model was adopted to design such messages, which have been iteratively refined performing a static analysis of their comprehension, sentiment, and readability.},

This provides potentially valuable insights into the deeper user experience that is often very easy to miss in the course of a usability test. These tools are becoming much easier to use, more accurate, more versatile and powerful, and even quite affordable. A structured approach to collecting unprompted verbal expressions during a usability test can be very helpful. Eye tracking can be a significant benefit in many kinds of usability tests. The technology continues to improve, becoming more accurate, easier to use, and less intrusive. The value is being able to compare the effectiveness of different designs, as well as calculate metrics based on areas of interest. There are three ways to measure emotions: skin conductance, facial expressions, and electroencephalography (EEG). Skin conductance measures level of arousal, facial expressions are classified and associated with six basic emotions, and EEG measures brain wave activity with unique signatures tied to specific emotional responses. There are new technologies based on each approach, and even integrate eye movement data into their applications. These are powerful new tools to gain insight into the emotional response of the user. Stress is an important component of the user experience. It is measured most often as heart rate variance. Other techniques for capturing information about the participant’s behavior, such as a mouse that registers how tightly it is being gripped, are on the horizon and may become useful additions to the battery of tools available for use in usability testing.}

abstract = {During the past two decades, the body of empirical research on warning design and evaluation has grown. Consequently, there are now basic principles and guidelines addressing warning design (e.g., signal words, color, symbols, and text/content), placement (e.g., location within product instructions), and how to enhance the usability of designs by considering factors internal to the user (e.g., beliefs, perceptions of risk, stress). Similarly, evaluation methods have been developed that can be used to measure the effectiveness of warnings such as the degree to which warnings are communicated to recipients and the degree to which they encourage or influence behavioral compliance. An overview of the empirical literature on warning guidelines and evaluation approaches is provided. Researchers, practitioners, and manufacturers can use these guidelines in various contexts to reduce the likelihood that injury and product damage from exposure to a hazard will occur.}

abstract = {The main challenge for security information and event management (SIEM) is to find critical security incidents among a huge number of false alerts generated from separate security products. To address the alert fatigue problem that is common for security experts operating the SIEM, we propose a new alert screening scheme that leverages artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted tools to distinguish actual threats from false alarms without investigating every alert. The proposed scheme incorporates carefully chosen learning algorithms and newly designed visualization tools to facilitate speedy alert analysis and incident response. The proposed scheme is evaluated on an alert dataset collected in the security operation center of an enterprise. With a recall rate of 99.598\% for highly critical alerts and a false positive rate of 0.001\% reported, the proposed scheme demonstrated very promising potential for real world security operations. We believe the proposed scheme is effective in addressing the alert fatigue problem, and therefore paves the way for a consolidated security solution for network security at the enterprise level.},
