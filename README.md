# Bachelorthesis - Plugin to Evaluate Email Phishing Warnings

This repository contains the source code for a Mozilla Thunderbird add-on developed as part of a bachelor's thesis. The add-on is designed to evaluate different types of phishing warnings.

## Features
- Animates and adds interactivity to hardcoded phishing warning banners in emails
- Please be aware that this add-on does not identify phishing emails. Instead, it serves as a prototype that uses predefined phishing warnings to assess different alert types.
