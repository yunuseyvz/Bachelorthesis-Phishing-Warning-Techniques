## Introduction to the Study Session

### Welcome

- Welcome
- The focus of our investigation is "Phishing Attempts".

### Consent Form

- Please read and sign.
- Remind participants that the session will be recorded via screen and audio recording, and eye-tracking data will be collected.
- Data will be anonymized.

### Preparation

- Important: Use a non-rolling chair for better eye-tracking results.
- Explanation of the eye tracker.
- Setup and explanation of Thunderbird (don't forget to install the addon).
- Setting up Tobii Pro Lab:
- Having a second screen is practical, allowing the study leader to view the moderator screen of Tobii Pro Lab and better understand the participant's actions.
 - Eye tracker calibration and screen recording are integrated into the timeline, ensuring calibration automatically occurs before recording starts.
 - Audio recording through a third-party program or smartphone.

## Conducting the Study

Participants are allowed to ask questions throughout if anything is unclear.

### Part 1: Email Sorting (~10 Min.)

#### Instructions

1. You are an employee at the fictional company Cloudtech.
2. You will see a folder with emails. Your task is to sort these emails.
3. Act naturally, as if it's your own work inbox that needs to be cleaned up and sorted.
4. Think aloud as you sort. Explain your thoughts and decisions.
5. You may click on links in the emails and open attachments.
6. I will simply listen/watch.
7. You have about 10 minutes.
8. After this task, I will ask you a few questions.
9. Do you have any questions before we proceed?

#### Start of Task

- Ready? -> Start recording and begin.

### Part 2: Detailed Interview (~10 Min.)

#### Transition to Interview

- Thank you for participating in the first part. Now, I would like to ask you a few more detailed questions.

#### Questions

1. **General Perception:**
    - How did you generally perceive the warnings?
    - Follow-up questions, e.g., if "Good", ask why exactly good or bad.
    - Were there elements in the warnings that particularly stood out to you? What caught your attention the most?
    - What role did the warning notices play in your decisions?

2. **Effectiveness of the Warnings:**
    - How do you assess the effectiveness of the various warning notices presented to you during the study?
    - Were there any warning notices you found particularly helpful or less helpful?
    - Each warning notice had 2 versions (simple/detailed). Which version do you prefer, and why? (Show the warnings again)

3. **Design of the Warning Notices:**
    - How do you evaluate the design of the warning notices (e.g., color, placement, animations)? Did these influence your attention?
    - How do you assess interactive elements in warning notices (e.g., greeting warning)?
    - Do you have any suggestions for improving the design of the warning notices?

4. **Personal Behavior:**
    - Were there any pieces of information in the warnings that you hadn't paid attention to before?
    - How do you usually handle emails once there's a suspicion of phishing? Or what specifically do you look at once there's a suspicion?

5. **Feedback**
    - Do you have any suggestions on how we could improve the study in the future?
    - Do you have any other questions or comments?
